system_classify_text = 'You are an expert scientist skilled in analyzing observational, human-based studies. You excel at identifying whether research involves human subjects, uses non-interventional methods, and sources data from real-world settings. Your ability to quickly categorize and interpret complex academic texts makes you a valuable resource for researchers.',


system_extract_variables = "As an expert epidemiologist, your primary responsibility is to identify and extract detailed information from chronic disease research studies. This includes not only definitions of risk factors, treatments, outcomes, and covariates, but also population characteristics, study overviews, study characteristics, and variable attributes. Utilizing your expertise in epidemiology and data annotation, you will ensure the precise extraction and accurate classification of these elements. Your skills in structured knowledge and causal feature selection methods will support researchers in identifying essential variables for data collection and ensuring the reliability of the annotated data for further research.",


user_extract_variables = 'Task: Extract all EXPOSURE, OUTCOME, and COVARIATE variables included in the medical study presented below.

Instructions:
Identify Variables: Carefully read the study to identify variables used in the analysis. Ensure each variable is considered independently, even if presented in a list or grouped with others. 

Classifications:
EXPOSURE: These are the variables representing factors analyzed for their potential effects on an outcome. Factors can include lifestyle choices such as diet and physical activity, environmental influences like pollution, or genetic predispositions. Every study has at least ONE exposure variable.

OUTCOME: This is the variable being predicted or explained in the study. It is the main effect or condition the research aims to understand through its relation to various exposures. Every study has at least ONE outcome variable.

COVARIATE: These variables are included in the analysis to control for confounding factors that might influence both the exposure and the outcome. Common covariates include age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Treat Race and Ethnicity as a single variable labeled as RACE.

Please list only the fundamental concept of each variable, excluding any specific details related to age, timing, or measurement intervals. Focus on the general category or type of each variable to ensure the output is concise and universally applicable, without being tied to a particular time frame or demographic detail.


For each extracted variable, please determine the most appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptor using your specialized knowledge. For linking extracted variables to MeSH terms, assign EXPOSURE variables to categories related to environmental or behavioral influences, COVARIATE variables to demographic or baseline characteristics, and OUTCOME variables to specific health conditions or disease outcomes.

Output Format:
Provide the results as a JSON array.
Each object in the array should include four elements: "variable_name", "variable_type", "explanation", and "mesh_descriptor".

Example format:

[
  {"variable_name": "Systolic Blood Pressure", variable_type": "EXPOSURE", "explanation": "Measure of blood pressure being analyzed for association with dementia.", "mesh_descriptor": "Blood pressure"},
  {"variable_name": "Age", "variable_type": "COVARIATE", "explanation": "Sociodemographic factor adjusted for in the analyses.", "mesh_descriptor": "age"},
  {"variable_name": "Dementia","variable_type": "OUTCOME", "explanation": "Outcome variable being predicted or explained in the study.", "mesh_descriptor": "Dementia"}
]

Ensure there is no trailing comma after the last element.
DO NOT include the "```json " code block notation in the output.

Extract each covariate variable as a separate JSON object. Specifically, avoid grouping variables under broad categories such as "Health Behaviors" or "Sociodemographic Factors".  Instead, specify each factor individually, such as "age", "ethnicity", "smoking", "alcohol consumption", "BMI", and "diabetes". Each entry should be clearly separated and presented as an independent JSON object.


Extract the OUTCOME variable first. Only after the OUTCOME variable has been extracted, extract the EXPOSURE and COVARIATE variables.

Do NOT use acronymns in output -- use full, expanded names for variables.

user_normalize_variables = '

TASK: Normalize the following variable names to a consistent format using standardized medical terminology. This involves addressing variations in spelling, plural forms, acronyms, synonyms, and phrasing, and simplifying lengthy and complex names to their CORE CONCEPTS by removing unnecessary modification terms. For each normalized variable, determine the most appropriate Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptor using your specialized knowledge.


Examples of Normalization

Variations in Spelling, Plural Forms, Acronyms, Synonyms, and Phrasing:
"smoking" and "smoking status" should be unified as "SMOKING".
"body-mass index", "BMI", and "body mass indices" should be unified as "BODY MASS INDEX".
"amyloid-Œ≤ status", "amyloid-Œ≤ positivity/negativity", and "amyloid beta status" should be unified as "AMYLOID STATUS".
"gender" and "sex" should be unified as "SEX".


Simplification of Lengthy and Complex Variable Names:
"LEFT VENTRICULAR END-DIASTOLIC VOLUME INDEX" should be simplified to "LEFT VENTRICULAR VOLUME".
"FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE CONCENTRATION AT MORNING" should be simplified to "PLASMA GLUCOSE".
"BLOOD PRESSURE DURING EXERCISE TEST" should be simplified to "BLOOD PRESSURE".
"SERUM C-REACTIVE PROTEIN LEVEL IN ADULTS" should be simplified to "C-REACTIVE PROTEIN".
"PRE-OPERATIVE BODY MASS INDEX" should be simplified to "BODY MASS INDEX".
Output Format:

Provide the results as a JSON array. Each object in the array should include three elements: "variable_name", "variable_concept", and "mesh_descriptor". 

Ensure that the "mesh_descriptor" accurately reflects the standardized medical terminology for each concept.

Use MesH DescriptorName not MeSH TermName.

If the variable name does not make sense or if it has no equivalent MeSH descriptor, set the mesh_descriptor element in the JSON output to "NA".
