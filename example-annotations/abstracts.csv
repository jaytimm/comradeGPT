A retrospective analysis of EHR data from a cohort of 7587 patients seen at a large, multi-specialty urban academic medical center in New York was conducted. Subphenotypes were derived using hierarchical clustering from 792 probable AD patients (cases) who had received at least one diagnosis of AD using their clinical data. The other 6795 patients, labeled as controls, were matched on age and gender with the cases and randomly selected in the ratio of 9:1. Prediction models with multiple ML algorithms were trained on this cohort using 5-fold cross-validation. XGBoost was used to rank the variable importance. Four subphenotypes were computationally derived. Subphenotype A (n = 273; 28.2%) had more patients with cardiovascular diseases; subphenotype B (n = 221; 27.9%) had more patients with mental health illnesses, such as depression and anxiety; patients in subphenotype C (n = 183; 23.1%) were overall older (mean (SD) age, 79.5 (5.4) years) and had the most comorbidities including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and mental health disorders; and subphenotype D (n = 115; 14.5%) included patients who took anti-dementia drugs and had sensory problems, such as deafness and hearing impairment.The 0-year prediction model for AD risk achieved an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.764 (SD: 0.02); the 6-month model, 0.751 (SD: 0.02); the 1-year model, 0.752 (SD: 0.02); the 2-year model, 0.749 (SD: 0.03); and the 3-year model, 0.735 (SD: 0.03), respectively. Based on variable importance, the top-ranked comorbidities included depression, stroke/transient ischemic attack, hypertension, anxiety, mobility impairments, and atrial fibrillation. The top-ranked medications included anti-dementia drugs, antipsychotics, antiepileptics, and antidepressants. Four subphenotypes were computationally derived that correlated with cardiovascular diseases and mental health illnesses. ML algorithms based on patient demographics, diagnosis, and treatment demonstrated promising results in predicting the risk of developing AD at different time points across an individual's lifespan."

We aimed to investigate the association between long-term blood pressure variability (BPV), brain injury, and cognitive decline in patients with mild cognitive symptoms and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a well-characterized small-vessel disease that causes cognitive decline in older adults. Using a prospective memory clinic cohort, we enrolled 102 participants, of whom 52 with probable CAA. All underwent a 3-tesla research MRI at baseline and annual neuropsychological evaluation over 2 years, for which standardized z-scores for four cognitive domains were calculated. BPV was assessed using a coefficient of variation derived from serial outpatient BP measurements (median 12) over five years. We measured the peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) as a marker of white matter integrity, and other neuroimaging markers of CAA, including lacunes and cortical cerebral microinfarcts. Using regression models, we evaluated the association of BPV with microstructural brain injury and whether CAA modified this association. We also examined the association of BPV with subsequent cognitive decline. Systolic BPV was dose-dependently associated with PSMD (estimate=0.22, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.39, p=0.010), independent of age, sex, mean BP, common vascular risk factors, brain atrophy, and CAA severity. The presence of probable CAA strengthened the association between BPV and PSMD (estimate=9.33, 95% CI: 1.32, 17.34, p for interaction = 0.023). Higher BPV correlated with greater ischemic injury (lobar lacunes and cortical cerebral microinfarcts) and a decline in global cognition and processing speed (estimate=-0.30, 95% CI: -0.55, -0.04, p=0.022). Long-term BPV has a dose-dependent association with alterations in white matter integrity, lobar lacunes, and cortical cerebral microinfarcts, and predicts cognitive decline. Controlling BPV is a potential strategic approach to prevent cognitive decline, especially in early-stage CAA."

The aim of the study was to provide basis for preventing MCI in cognitive normal populations. The data came from a longitudinal retrospective study involving individuals with brain magnetic resonance imaging scans, clinical visits, and cognitive assessment with interval of more than 3 years. Multiple machine-learning technologies, including random forest, support vector machine, logistic regression, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and na√Øve Bayes, were used to establish a prediction model of a future risk of MCI through a combination of clinical and image variables. Among these machine learning models; eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) was the best classification model. The classification accuracy of clinical variables was 65.90%, of image variables was 79.54%, of a combination of clinical and image variables was 94.32%. The best result of the combination was an accuracy of 94.32%, a precision of 96.21%, and a recall of 93.08%. XGB with a combination of clinical and image variables had a potential prospect for the risk prediction of MCI. From clinical perspective, the degree of white matter hyperintensity (WMH), especially in the frontal lobe, and the control of systolic blood pressure (SBP) were the most important risk factor for the development of MCI. The best MCI classification results came from the XGB model with a combination of both clinical and imaging variables. The degree of WMH in the frontal lobe and SBP control were the most important variables in predicting MCI."

In addition to high blood pressure (BP), individuals may also experience variable BP, meaning that their BP fluctuates between normal and high. It is currently unclear what the effects of variable BP are on cognition and brain structure. To investigate the influence of BP on cognition and brain structure in older adults. This longitudinal cohort study included data from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Research Resource Sharing Hub (RUSH) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Participants from the two studies were included if they had BP measurements and either cognitive scores or MRI scans from at least one visit. Longitudinal gray matter, white matter, white matter hyperintensity volumes, postmortem neuropathology information, as well as cognitive test scores. A total of 4606 participants (3429 females, mean age = 76.8) with 32776 follow-ups (mean = 7 years) from RUSH and 2114 participants (1132 females, mean age = 73.3) with 9827 follow-ups (mean = 3 years) from ADNI were included in this study. Participants were divided into one of three groups: 1) normal BP, high BP, or variable BP. Older adults with variable BP exhibited the highest rate of cognitive decline followed by high BP and then normal BP. Increased GM volume loss and WMH burden was also observed in variable BP compared to high and normal BP. With respect to post-mortem neuropathology, both variable and high BP had increased severities compared to normal BP. Importantly, results were consistent across the RUSH and ADNI participants, supporting the generalizability of the findings. Limited research has examined the long-term impact of variable BP on cognition and brain structure. These findings show the importance that both high and variable BP have on cognitive decline and structural brain changes. Structural damages caused by variable BP may reduce resilience to future dementia-related pathology and increased risk of dementia. Improved treatment and management of variable BP may help reduce cognitive decline in the older adult population."

A previous study in a Southern region reported one of the highest prevalences of dementia in Latin America. To investigate the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment associated with low education, rurality, and demographic characteristics. A cross-sectional study recruited a community-dwelling sample of 823 adults from rural and urban areas of two Southern provinces of Colombia from 2020-2022. Participants were assessed with a neuropsychological protocol validated in Colombia. To obtain general and region-specific prevalence rates, age, sex, schooling, and socioeconomic level were considered and controlled for. Most of the participants reported low education and socioeconomic level, the participation of women was higher. It was determined that the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was 53.6%, with 56.6% in the province of Caquet√° followed by 51.9% in the province of Huila. The amnestic MCI represented 42.6%, the amnestic multi-domain was 39%, the non-amnestic 16.55%, and the non-amnestic multi-domain 1.81%. Our participants reported comorbidities such as diabetes and hypertension. We also observed a relationship between exposure to pesticides and MCI. We observed one of the highest prevalences of MCI in Latin America reported to date. Variables such as age, gender, and education proved risk factors for MCI in the explored regions. Our findings are very much in line with recent studies that highlight the influence of non-canonical risk factors of dementia in underrepresented countries from Latin America."

However, their sensitivity and specificity are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to determine whether the RDW to Ca ratio (RCR) acquired on admission can be used to predict the in-hospital mortality of AMI patients. This retrospective cohort study extracted clinical information from the Medical Information Market for Intensive IV (MIMIC-IV) database on 2,910 AMI patients enrolled via propensity score matching (PSM). Prognostic values were assessed using a multivariate logistic model and three PSM approaches. Analysis was performed based on stratified variables and interactions among sex, age, ethnicity, anemia, renal disease, percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, dementia, diabetes, paraplegia, hypertension, cerebrovascular disease, and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score. A total of 4,105 ICU-admitted AMI patients were analyzed. The optimal cut-off value of the RCR for in-hospital mortality was 1.685. The PSM was performed to identify 1,455 pairs (2,910) of score-matched patients, with balanced differences exhibited for nearly all variables.The patients' median age was 72 years (range, 63-82 years) and 60.9% were male. The risk of in-hospital mortality incidence increased with increasing RCR levels. After adjusting for confounders, the risk ratio for the incidence of in-hospital mortality for high RCR was 1.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-1.94, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0113] compared to that associated with low RCR in the PSM cohort. High RCR was also substantially implicated in in-hospital mortality incidence in the weighted cohorts [odds ratio (OR)‚Äâ=‚Äâ1.76, 95% CI: 1.62-1.94, P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.0129]. Assessment of RCR in three groups showed that patients with high RCR also had a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (OR‚Äâ=‚Äâ3.04; 95% CI, 2.22-4.16; P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.0001) than in patients with RCR in the adjusted model. In the sensitivity analysis, both the original and weighted groups showed similar results. The RCR at admission may be useful for predicting in-hospital mortality in ICU-admitted AMI patients."

However, the exact role of APOE4 in mediating interactions between the peripheral circulatory system and the central nervous system, and how it may link to brain and cognitive aging requires further elucidation. In this analysis, we investigated the association between APOE4 carrier status and multimodal biomarkers (diet, blood markers, clinical diagnosis, brain structure, and cognition) in the context of gene-environment interactions. Participants were older adults from a longitudinal observational study, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study (BPRHS), who self-identified as of Puerto Rican descent. Demographics, APOE genotype, diet, blood, and clinical data were collected at baseline and at approximately 12th year, with the addition of multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (T1-weighted and diffusion) and cognitive testing acquired at 12-year. Measures were compared between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers, and associations between multimodal variables were examined using correlation and multivariate network analyses within each group. A total of 156 BPRHS participants (mean age at imaging‚Äâ=‚Äâ68‚Äâyears, 77% female, mean follow-up 12.7‚Äâyears) with complete multimodal data were included in the current analysis. APOE4 carriers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ43) showed reduced medial temporal lobe (MTL) white matter (WM) microstructural integrity and lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score than non-carriers (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ113). This pattern was consistent with an independent sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) of n‚Äâ=‚Äâ283 non-Hispanic White adults without dementia (mean age‚Äâ=‚Äâ75, 40% female). Within BPRHS, carriers showed distinct connectivity patterns between multimodal biomarkers, characterized by stronger direct network connections between baseline diet/blood markers with 12-year blood/clinical measures, and between blood markers (especially lipids and cytokines) and WM. Cardiovascular burden (i.e., hypertension and diabetes status) was associated with WM integrity for both carriers and non-carriers. APOE4 carrier status affects interactions between dietary factors, multimodal blood biomarkers, and MTL WM integrity across ~12‚Äâyears of follow-up, which may reflect increased peripheral-central systems crosstalk following blood-brain barrier breakdown in carriers."

These areas include the advancement of techniques such as the accumulation of amyloid-Œ≤ and tau proteins, the monitoring of cerebral hypometabolism rates etc. The primary objective of this study is to explore the intricate interplay between Alzheimer's disease (AD)-other dementias (D) and various chronic illnesses in terms of time, intensity, and connectivity. In this context, we retrospectively examined data of 149,786 individuals aged 65 and above who received diagnoses of AD and D in the year 2020. At first, logistic regression (LR) analysis has been made with ""sex"", ""age"" and ""foreigner"" (citizenship status) independent variables for AD and D. The LR models shows that while ""sex"" and ""age"" variables have a small rate on the risk of developing AD/D, it is detected that being a foreigner increase the risk of AD and D as 69.8% and 88.5% respectively. Besides, the LR models have middle-level success prediction rate for both of the two dependent variables. Additionally, we used the parallel coordinates graphs method within the R Studio to visualize their relationships and connections. The findings of this investigation strongly suggest that AD/D don't stand as isolated conditions, but rather stem from intricate interactions and progressive processes involving diverse chronic diseases over time. Notably, ailments including hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and psychological disorders, contribute substantially to the emergence of both AD and D. This study highlights that the fight against AD/D can only be possible with next-generation prophylactic interventions that can predict and manage risks. Such an approach holds the potential to potentially lower AD and dementia to levels that are amenable to treatment."

A mean (SD) of 28.4 (8.4) yearly SBP measurements were available over 31.5 (9.0) years. The mean (SD) follow-up time was 32.2 (9.1) years in 27‚ÄØ885 person-years from midlife to death. Of the participants, 372 (45.4%) developed dementia. The number of participants who were alive without dementia and had available data for analysis ranged from 280 of those aged 90 years to 702 of those aged 70 years. Higher BPV was not associated with higher lifetime dementia risk at age 60, 70, or 80 years. At age 90 years, BPV was associated with 35% higher dementia risk (hazard ratio [HR], 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02-1.79). Meta-regression of HRs calculated separately for each age (60-90 years) indicated that associations of high BPV with higher dementia risk were present only at older ages, whereas the association of SBP with dementia gradually shifted direction linearly from being incrementally to inversely associated with older ages. In this cohort study, high BPV indicated increased lifetime dementia risk in late life but not in midlife. This result suggests that high BPV may indicate increased dementia risk in older age but might be less viable as a midlife dementia prevention target."

To assess the associations of hypertension history, antihypertensive use, and baseline measured BP in late life (age >60 years) with dementia and the moderating factors of age, sex, and racial group. Longitudinal, population-based studies of aging participating in the Cohort Studies of Memory in an International Consortium (COSMIC) group were included. Participants were individuals without dementia at baseline aged 60 to 110 years and were based in 15 different countries (US, Brazil, Australia, China, Korea, Singapore, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Germany, Spain, Italy, France, Sweden, and Greece). Participants were grouped in 3 categories based on previous diagnosis of hypertension and baseline antihypertensive use: healthy controls, treated hypertension, and untreated hypertension. Baseline systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were treated as continuous variables. Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses of Individual Participant Data reporting guidelines. The key outcome was all-cause dementia. Mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the associations between the exposures and the key outcome variable. The association between dementia and baseline BP was modeled using nonlinear natural splines. The main analysis was a partially adjusted Cox proportional hazards model controlling for age, age squared, sex, education, racial group, and a random effect for study. Sensitivity analyses included a fully adjusted analysis, a restricted analysis of those individuals with more than 5 years of follow-up data, and models examining the moderating factors of age, sex, and racial group.

There was no significant association of baseline SBP or DBP with dementia risk in any of the analyses. There were no significant interactions with age, sex, or racial group for any of the analyses. This individual patient data meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies found that antihypertensive use was associated with decreased dementia risk compared with individuals with untreated hypertension through all ages in late life. Individuals with treated hypertension had no increased risk of dementia compared with healthy controls."

Despite advances in treatment, gender disparities are yet to be addressed. Methods This retrospective cohort study used nationally representative data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), specifically the National Inpatient Sample, to study two cohorts divided by sex (males and females). The primary outcome was all-cause inpatient mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis yielded adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for confounders. Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS) and total hospital charges. Multivariate linear regression identified independent predictors. We described crude rates of mechanical ventilation, acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring hemodialysis (HD), and vasopressor requirements. Patient demographics were also presented. We used the chi-squared (œá2) test for categorical variables and Student's t-test for continuous variables. Statistical significance was defined as a two-tailed p-value<0.05. Results A total of 229,025 patients met the inclusion criteria, where 52% were male¬†and 48% were female. The mean patient age was 58 years (55 for men and 62 for women, p <0.001). White patients represented 40% of hospitalizations (males: 37%; females: 42%), black patients represented 42% (males: 43%; females: 41%), and Hispanics 11% (males: 12%; females: 10%). Medicare was the primary payer 47% of the time (males: 38%; females: 56%), Medicaid in 21% (males: 23%; females: 18%), private insurance in 20% (males: 23%; females: 17%), and no insurance in 10% (males: 14%; females: 7%). Female patients had higher rates¬†of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (21% for females vs. 15% for males), connective tissue disease (4.6% for females vs. 0.98% for males; p<0.001), and dementia (6% for females vs. 3% for males). Conversely, males had a higher rate of¬†chronic kidney disease (CKD) (51% vs. 42% for females). Male sex was a predictor of mortality (aOR 1.39, p=0.036), along with age (aOR 1.02, p<0.001) and Charlson Comorbidity Index (http://mchp-appserv.cpe.umanitoba.ca/viewConcept.php?printer=Y&conceptID=1098) (aOR 1.20, p<0.001). Sex was not a predictor of length of stay (LOS) (p=0.496) or total hospital charges (p=0.192). Conclusions In an attempt to achieve better outcomes in patients affected by hypertensive emergency, our retrospective cohort study found that male patients who experienced hypertensive emergency had 39% higher odds of mortality than female patients. Age and Charlson Comorbidity Index were additionally found to be independent predictors of mortality."

The purpose of this study was to describe the generalizability of a recently proposed grading system of CADASIL across multiple centers in the United States. Electronic medical records (EMR) of an initial neurological assessment of adult patients with confirmed CADASIL were reviewed across 5 tertiary referral medical centers with expertise in CADASIL. Demographic, vascular risk factors, and neuroimaging data were abstracted from EMR. Patients were categorized into groups according to the proposed CADASIL grading system: Grade 0 (asymptomatic), Grade 1 (migraine only), Grade 2 (stroke, TIA, or MCI), Grade 3 (gait assistance or dementia), and Grade 4 (bedbound or end-stage). Inter-rater reliability (IRR) of grading was tested in a subset of cases. We identified 138 patients with a mean age of 50.9¬†¬± 13.1 years, and 57.2% were female. The IRR was acceptable over 33 cases (Œ∫=0.855, SD 0.078, p<0.001) with 81.8% being concordant. There were 15 patients (10.9%) with Grade 0, 50 (36.2%) with Grade 1, 61 (44.2%) with Grade 2, 12 (8.7%) with Grade 3, and none with Grade 4. Patients with a lower severity grade (grade 0¬†vs 3) tended to be younger (49.5¬†vs. 61.9 years) and had a lower prevalence of hypertension (50% vs. 20%, p¬†=¬†0.027) and diabetes mellitus (0% vs. 25%, p¬†=¬†0.018). A higher severity grade was associated with an increased number of vascular risk factors (p¬†=¬†0.02) and independently associated with hypertension and diabetes (p<0.05). Comparing Grade 0¬†vs. 3, cortical thickness tended to be greater (2.06¬†vs. 1.87¬†mm; p¬†=¬†0.06) and white matter hyperintensity volume tended to be lower (54.7¬†vs. 72.5¬†ml; p¬†=¬†0.73), but the differences did not reach significance. The CADASIL severity grading system is a pragmatic, reliable system for characterizing CADASIL phenotype that does not require testing beyond that done in standard clinical practice. Higher severity grades tended to have a higher vascular risk factor burden. This system offers a simple method of categorizing CADASIL patients which may help to describe populations in observational and interventional studies."

Therefore, it is important to have up-to-date studies that address a standard assessment of psychosocial, clinical and lifestyle variables. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study, with a 24-month timeframe, to estimate the relationship between risk and protective factors associated with dementia, according to the A-to-Z Dementia Knowledge. Participants were considered at CI risk if they tested positive for at least one of three validated CI screening tests: The Memory Impairment Screening, Short Portable Mental State Questionnaire, and Semantic Verbal Fluency. The A-to-Z data Collection included Mediterranean Diet Adherence Screener and Geriatric Depression Scale. The estimated prevalence of CI was 22.6% in a sample of 709 patients with an average of 69.3¬±10.3 years. The risk factors gradually associated with cognitive decline were hypertension, loneliness, and depression. In contrast, the protective factors gradually associated with less cognitive decline were internet use, reading, and intellectually stimulating jobs. Finally, living alone, having diabetes, taking benzodiazepines, and sleeping more than 9 h were statistically significant associated with CI, whereas to do memory training or a family history of dementia was characteristic of patients without CI. A joint assessment of the influence of psychosocial, clinical, and lifestyle-related factors is needed to develop dementia prevention strategies."

While circadian blood pressure fluctuations are important determinants of end-organ damage, the role of 24-h PWV variability is yet unclear. We here investigated the association between PWV and its circadian changes on brain morphology and cognitive function in community-dwelling individuals. Single-centre, prospective, community-based follow-up study. The study cohort comprised elderly community-based participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study which was started in 2006. Patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease or dementia were excluded. The study consists of 84 participants who underwent ambulatory 24-h PWV measurement. White matter hyperintensity volume and brain volume were evaluated by 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A subgroup of patients was evaluated for cognitive function using an extensive neuropsychological test battery. PWV was significantly related to reduced total brain volume (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.013), which was independent of blood pressure and blood pressure variability. We found no association between PWV with markers of cerebral SVD or impaired cognitive functioning. Only night-time PWV values were associated with global brain atrophy (p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.005). This study shows a relationship of arterial stiffness and reduced total brain volume. Elevations in PWV during night-time are of greater importance than day-time measures."

This case-control study aims to assess whether antihypertensive medication has a protective role by studying its association with amyloid and tau abnormal levels. Furthermore, it suggests a holistic view of the involved pathways between renin-angiotensin drugs and the tau/amyloid√ü42 ratio (tau/A√ü42 ratio); (2) Methods: The medical records of the participant patients were reviewed, with a focus on prescribed antihypertensive drugs and clinical variables, such as arterial blood pressure. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification was used to classify each drug. The patients were divided into two groups: patients with AD diagnosis (cases) and cognitively healthy patients (control); (3) Results: Age and high systolic blood pressure are associated with a higher risk of developing AD. In addition, combinations of angiotensin II receptor blockers are associated with a 30% lower t-tau/A√ü42 ratio than plain angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor consumption; (4) Conclusions: Angiotensin II receptor blockers may play a potential role in neuroprotection and AD prevention. Likewise, several mechanisms, such as the PI3K/Akt/GSK3√ü or the ACE1/AngII/AT1R axis, may link cardiovascular pathologies and AD presence, making its modulation a pivotal point in AD prevention.

We aimed to assess the clinical features and explore the underlying biomarkers as predictors of CI in patients with newly diagnosed PD (NDPD; less than 2 years). We evaluated the cognitive function status using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline and subsequent annual follow-up for 5 years from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. We assessed the baseline clinical features, apolipoprotein (APO) E status, Œ≤-glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation status, cerebrospinal fluid findings, and dopamine transporter imaging results. Using a diagnosis of CI (combined mild cognitive impairment and dementia) developed during the 5-year follow-up as outcome measures, we assessed the predictive values of baseline clinical variables and biomarkers. We also constructed a predictive model for the diagnosis of CI using logistic regression analysis. A total of 409 patients with NDPD with 5-year follow-up were enrolled, 232 with normal cognitive function at baseline, and 94 patients developed CI during the 5-year follow-up. In multivariate analyses, age, current diagnosis of hypertension, baseline MoCA scores, Movement disorder society Unified PD Rating Scale part III (MDS-UPDRS III) scores, and APOE status were associated with the development of CI. Predictive accuracy of CI using age alone improved by the addition of clinical variables and biomarkers (current diagnosis of hypertension, baseline MoCA scores, and MDS-UPDRS III scores, APOE status; AUC 0.80 [95% CI 0.74-0.86] vs. 0.71 [0.64-0.77], p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008). Cognitive domains that had higher frequencies of impairment were found in verbal memory (12.6 vs. 16.8%) and attention/processing speed (12.7 vs. 16.9%), however, no significant difference in the prevalence of CI at annual follow-up was found during the 5-year follow-up in NDPD patients. In NDPD, the development of CI during the 5-year follow-up can be predicted with good accuracy using a model combining age, current diagnosis of hypertension, baseline MoCA scores, MDS-UPDRS III scores, and APOE status.

Moreover, 26 types of care needs were included in this study. The Apriori algorithm was employed to first identify care need combinations and then to find the relationships between care needs and variables from dementia patients with multiple chronic diseases. Six rules were generated for care need combinations. Four care needs could be formed as a basic care need bundle.

Arterial stiffness was evaluated via pulse wave analysis and pulse wave velocity (PWV) and cerebrovascular pulsatility was assessed via transcranial doppler sonography of the middle cerebral arteries. High systolic as well as diastolic short- and mid-term BPV were associated with poorer cognitive functioning, independent of the mean BP. Higher short-term BPV was associated with poorer attention and psychomotor speed, whilst day-to-day BPV was negatively linked with executive functioning. Circadian BP patterns (dipping and morning BP surge) showed no significant relationships with cognition after adjusting for covariates. Higher systolic short-term BPV was associated with higher arterial stiffness (PWV) and higher diastolic day-to-day BPV was linked with lower arterial stiffness. No significant associations between BPV measures and cerebrovascular pulsatility were present. High BPV, independently of the mean BP, is associated with lower cognitive performance and increased arterial stiffness in older adults without clinically-relevant cognitive impairment. This highlights the role of systolic and diastolic BPV as a potential early clinical marker for cognitive impairment."

Multivariate covariance-based analyses adjusted for age, sex, education, total intracranial volume, and presence of mild cognitive impairment identified gray matter volume (GMV) patterns associated with pace and rhythm, as well as participant-specific expression (or factor) scores for each pattern. Pace was positively associated with GMV in the right superior temporal sulcus, bilateral supplementary motor areas (SMA), and bilateral cerebellar regions. Rhythm was positively associated with GMV in bilateral SMA, prefrontal, cingulate, and paracingulate cortices. The GMV pattern associated with pace was less expressed in participants with any vascular disease; this association was also found independently with hypertension, diabetes, and myocardial infarction. Both pace and rhythm domains of gait were associated with the volume of brain structures that have been linked to controlled and automatic aspects of gait control, as well as with structures involved in multisensory integration.

A vast number of stored images (well over a million) of longitudinal scans and extensive health data are available, offering a valuable resource for investigating the prevalence of various types of brain-related health conditions occurring throughout adulthood. In this paper, we report on the findings of our preliminary quantitative analysis of T1-weighted MRIs of the brain obtained from 13‚Äâ980 subjects from three participating sites during the period 2015-19. We applied automated segmentation analysis and observed age-dependent volume loss of various brain structures. We subsequently investigated the effects of scan protocols and the feasibility of calibration for pooling the data. Last, the degree of brain atrophy was correlated with four known risk factors of dementia; blood glucose level, hypertension, obesity, and alcohol consumption. In this initial analysis, we identified brain ventricular volume as an effective marker of age-dependent brain atrophy, being highly sensitive to ageing and evidencing strong robustness against protocol variability. We established the normal range of ventricular volumes at each age, which is an essential first step for establishing criteria used to interpret data obtained for individual participants. We identified a subgroup of individuals at midlife with ventricles that substantially exceeded the average size. The correlation studies revealed that all four risk factors were associated with greater ventricular volumes at midlife, some of which reached highly significant sizes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of conducting a large-scale quantitative analysis of existing Brain Dock data in Japan. It will importantly guide future efforts to investigate the prevalence of large ventricles at midlife and the potential reduction of this prevalence, and hence of dementia risk, through lifestyle changes."

This cross-sectional study involved 725 community-dwelling older Japanese adults without cardiovascular diseases. We estimated absolute cardiovascular risk using the World Health Organization risk estimation charts, which include variables such as age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol, and stratified cardiovascular risk level into three risk categories: low (‚â§ 9%), moderate (10-14%), and high (‚â•15%). We measured daily physical activity using a triaxial accelerometer, and calculated the average time spent in moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) and light intensity physical activity (LPA). We performed brain T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and calculated the volume of the cortical gray matter, subcortical gray matter, and cerebral white matter, using the FreeSurfer software. In the overall sample, multivariable linear regression analysis showed that greater MVPA was significantly associated with greater volume of the cortical gray matter and cerebral white matter, and greater LPA was significantly associated with greater volume of the cerebral white matter. Additionally, in the analysis of the sample stratified by absolute cardiovascular risk level, cerebral white matter volume was significantly associated with both MVPA and LPA in the high cardiovascular risk group. The association between physical activity and brain volume differed according to cardiovascular risk level in community-dwelling older adults. In a population at high cardiovascular risk, maintaining or increasing LPA might be a practical and achievable strategy for healthy brain aging."

Aging of the population and the increasing prevalence of CKD in elderly patients are making dementia more prevalent. Blood pressure (BP) variability is an important risk factor for dementia. Although ample data link high BP variability with the risk of dementia in the general population, data on CKD patients are scarce. An observational cohort study conducted by Park et al., including 103 139 patients, demonstrated a strong association between higher visit-to-visit BP variability and increased risk of dementia in CKD patients. Both higher systolic and diastolic BP variabilities were associated with any type of dementia, including Alzheimer's and vascular dementia.

A 250 healthy elderly Jordanians were interviewed and tested for their MMSE score. Their scores were analyzed and the effect of age, gender, education, marital status, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), smoking, dyslipidemia, heart disease (HD), and family history of dementia (FHD) on the score was studied. MMSE scores of 236 elderly subjects, aged 63¬±8.4 years (range 50-86 years) were analyzed. There were 111 (47%) males. There was a direct correlation between MMSE score and education level. People with a higher education (college) had the highest scores in comparison with people who are illiterates or have a high school level. The score correlated negatively with age (Pearson correlation r¬†=¬†-0.23, p¬†=¬†0.00). Other studied variables did not correlate with score on multivariate analysis.

However, the association between cognition and hearing acuity at different frequencies is unknown. We aimed to assess the relationships between hearing acuity at different frequencies with global cognitive function and five domains of cognition among a low-income elderly population in northern rural China. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted to collect basic information from elderly residents aged 60 years and older in rural areas of Tianjin, China from April 2012 to November 2013. Pure tone averages (PTAs) at different frequencies in the ear with better hearing and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were measured, and the relationships between these variables were assessed. A total of 737 residents aged 60 years or more were enrolled in this study, and the prevalence of hearing impairment was 60.7%. After adjusting for sex, age, education, income, smoking, drinking, systolic blood pressure (SBP), total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (LDL-C), MMSE score and immediate recall score were negatively associated with overall PTA (OPTA) at four frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz), PTA at low frequencies (LPTA; 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz), and PTA at high frequencies (HPTA; 3, 4, and 8 kHz) in the ear with better hearing. Moreover, orientation score was negatively associated with OPTA and LPTA, and the attention and calculation scores were negatively associated with OPTA and HPTA. Each 10-dB increase in OPTA was associated with a MMSE score decrease of 0.464. Each 10-dB increase in LPTA or HPTA was associated with a MMSE score decrease of 0.441 (95% CI: -0.795, -0.086) and 0.351 (95% CI: -0.592, -0.110), respectively. The present study demonstrated significant but weak relationships between OPTA, LPTA, and HPTA with global cognitive function, as defined using MMSE scores; these relationships were independent of age, education, lifestyle factors, and laboratory test values. These results indicated that hearing was associated with cognitive decline among older individuals, who should be screened routinely to identify risk for cognitive decline."

However, despite several epidemiological studies investigating the link between OSA and cognitive decline, there is still no consensus on whether OSA increases the risk of dementia or not. Part of the heterogeneity observed in previous studies might be related to some individual characteristics that modulate the association between OSA and cognitive decline. In this narrative review, we present these individual characteristics, namely, age, sex, menopause, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, depression, air pollution, Apolipoprotein E Œµ4 allele, physical activity, and cognitive reserve. To date, large cohort studies of OSA and cognitive decline tended to statistically control for the effects of these variables, but whether they interact with OSA to predict cognitive decline remains to be elucidated.

We included community-dwelling fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries with ADRD, diagnosed with COVID-19 between April 1, 2020, and December 1, 2020 (N¬†= 138,533). Two outcome variables were defined: hospitalization within 14¬†days and death within 30¬†days of COVID-19 diagnosis. We obtained information on individual sociodemographic characteristics, chronic conditions, and prior health care utilization based on the Medicare claims and the Minimum Dataset. Machine learning methods, including lasso regression and discriminative pattern mining, were used to identify risk factors in racial/ethnic subgroups (ie, White, Black, and Hispanic individuals). The associations between identified risk factors and outcomes were evaluated using logistic regression and compared across racial/ethnic subgroups using the coefficient comparison approach. We found higher risks of COVID-19-related outcomes among Black and Hispanic individuals. The areas under the curve of the models with identified risk factors were 0.65 to 0.68 for mortality and 0.61 to 0.62 for hospitalization across racial/ethnic subgroups. Although some identified risk factors (eg, age, gender) for COVID-19-related outcomes were common among all racial/ethnic subgroups, other risk factors (eg, hypertension, obesity) varied by racial/ethnic subgroups. Furthermore, the associations between some common risk factors and COVID-19-related outcomes also varied by race/ethnicity. Being male was related to 138.2% (95% CI: 1.996-2.841), 64.7% (95% CI: 1.546-1.755), and 37.1% (95% CI: 1.192-1.578) increased odds of death among Hispanic, White, and Black individuals, respectively. In addition, the racial/ethnic disparity in COVID-19-related outcomes could not be completely explained by the identified risk factors. Racial/ethnic differences were detected in the likelihood of having COVID-19-related outcomes, specific risk factors, and relationships between specific risk factors and COVID-19-related outcomes.

Thirty-six patients with Huntington's disease (16 premanifest and 20 manifest) and 36 controls matched by age, sex, smoking status, and hypertension status underwent macular volumetric and peripapillary optical coherence tomography scans. Disease duration, motor status, global cognition and CAG repeats were recorded in patients. Group differences in imaging parameters and their association with clinical outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models. Premanifest and manifest Huntington's disease patients presented thinner retinal external limiting membrane-Bruch's membrane complex, and manifest patients had thinner temporal peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer compared to controls. In manifest Huntington's disease, macular thickness was significantly associated with MoCA scores, inner nuclear layer showing the largest regression coefficients. This relationship was consistent after adjusting for age, sex, and education and p-value correction with False Discovery Rate. None of the retinal variables were related to Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale score, disease duration, or disease burden. Premanifest patients did not show a significant association between OCT-derived parameters and clinical outcomes in corrected models.

In our primary analysis using a Poisson regression model, associations between biopsychosocial variables and SCD were identified (analytic sample: n = 21,920). In a second analysis using an ordinal regression model, associations between biopsychosocial variables and SCD-related worry were identified (analytic sample: n = 12,694). Multiple risk and protective factors of cognitive decline were not associated with SCD within our sample (i.e., physical activity, hypertension, vision problems), as well as minority stress variables such as sexual orientation and race. Rather, psychosocial variables (i.e., depression, perceived social status, and personality traits) showed a more consistent association with SCD within the sample. Greater SCD-related worry, which is believed to increase the risk of future dementia, was associated with specific personality traits, depression, age, gender, and sexuality. The results from this study confirm the association between multiple health variables and SCD but also emphasize the importance of considering psychological and social factors when conceptualizing SCD and its risk factors."

Emerging evidence suggests that Œ≤-blockers (Œ≤-adrenergic antagonists) increase brain clearance of these metabolites by enhancing CSF flow. Our objective was to determine whether Œ≤-blocker treatments that easily cross the blood-brain barrier reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to less permeable Œ≤-blockers. Data from the Danish national registers were used to identify a retrospective cohort of individuals with hypertension, and those treated with Œ≤-blockers were included in the analysis. People with indications for Œ≤-blocker use other than hypertension (e.g. heart failure) were only retained in a sensitivity analysis. Œ≤-blockers were divided into three permeability groups: low, moderate and high. We used multivariable cause-specific Cox regression to model the effect of Œ≤-blocker blood-brain barrier permeability on time to dementia outcomes, adjusting for baseline comorbidities, demographics and socioeconomic variables. Death was modelled as a competing risk. The 10-year standardized absolute risk was estimated as the averaged person-specific risks per treatment. In a cohort of 69 081 (median age = 64.4 years, 64.8% female) people treated with Œ≤-blockers for hypertension, highly blood-brain barrier-permeable Œ≤-blockers were associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease versus low permeability Œ≤-blockers (-0.45%, P < 0.036). This effect was specific to Alzheimer's diagnoses and did not extend to dementia in general. Propensity score analysis matching high and low blood-brain barrier-permeable patients also detected a decreased Alzheimer's risk (-0.92%, P < 0.001) in the high permeability group compared to the low, as did a 1-year landmark analysis (-0.57%, P < 0.029) in which events within the first year of follow-up were ignored as likely unrelated to treatment. Our results suggest that amongst people taking Œ≤-blockers for hypertension, treatment with highly blood-brain barrier permeable Œ≤-blockers reduces the risk of Alzheimer's disease compared to low permeability drugs. Our findings support the hypothesis that highly permeable Œ≤-blockers protect against Alzheimer's disease by promoting waste brain metabolite clearance."

PS matching was performed to balance the baseline characteristics of each comorbidity and to adjust for potential confounders, such as age, sex, Charlson Comorbidity Index, medication, and other comorbidities, that were matched with binary variables. The outcomes were the confirmed comorbidities affecting the infection rate and severity of COVID-19. The endpoints were COVID-19 positivity and severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 (such as tracheostomy, continuous renal replacement therapy, intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death). The COVID-19 cohort with PS matching included 8070 individuals with positive COVID-19 test results and 8070 matched controls. The proportions of patients in the severe group were higher for individuals 60 years or older (severe clinical outcomes for those 60 years or older, 16.52%; severe clinical outcomes for those of other ages, 2.12%), those insured with Medicaid (Medicaid, 10.81%; other insurance, 5.61%), and those with disabilities (with disabilities, 18.26%; without disabilities, 5.07%). The COVID-19 infection rate was high for patients with pulmonary disease (odds ratio [OR] 1.88; 95% CI 1.70-2.03), dementia (OR 1.75; 95% CI 1.40-2.20), gastrointestinal disease (OR 1.74; 95% CI 1.62-1.88), stroke (OR 1.67; 95% CI 1.23-2.27), hepatobiliary disease (OR 1.31; 95% CI 1.19-1.44), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.16-1.43), and cardiovascular disease (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07-1.35). In contrast, it was lower for individuals with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.67-0.80), autoimmune disease (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.89), and cancer (OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.62-0.86). The severity of COVID-19 was high for individuals with kidney disease (OR 5.59; 95% CI 2.48-12.63), hypertension (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), dementia (OR 2.92; 95% CI 1.91-4.47), cancer (OR 1.84; 95% CI 1.15-2.94), pulmonary disease (OR 1.72; 95% CI 1.35-2.19), cardiovascular disease (OR 1.54; 95% CI 1.17-2.04), diabetes mellitus (OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.09-1.87), and psychotic disorders (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.01-6.52). However, it was low for those with hyperlipidemia (OR 0.78; 95% CI 0.60-1.00). Upon PS matching considering the use of statins, it was concluded that people with hyperlipidemia could have lower infection rates and disease severity of COVID-19."

More recently, plasma biomarkers have been gaining recognition, but whether they exhibit similar differences is unclear. Furthermore, the underlying explanation for these differences in AD biomarkers is still unexplored. To investigate differences in plasma biomarkers by race and genetic ancestry and explore potential underlying explanations for these differences. This cross-sectional study used participant data from the Brain, Stress, Hypertension, and Aging Research Program (B-SHARP), an observational study conducted in the greater Atlanta metropolitan area. Participants were enrolled from March 1, 2016, to January 1, 2020. Main outcomes were plasma and CSF amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) 42, AŒ≤40, phosphorylated tau181 (p-tau181), and neurofilament light. General linear models were used for key comparisons. Main independent variables were self-identified race and genetic ancestry. Additional variables were cardiovascular factors, APOE4, educational attainment, Area Deprivation Index, and C-reactive protein (reflecting systemic inflammation state). This analysis included 617 participants (mean [SD] age, 66 [7.9] years; 300 [49%] African American and 317 [51%] White; 429 [70%] with mild cognitive impairment). On the basis of self-reported race, plasma levels of AŒ≤42 (adjusted mean difference, -1.20 pg/mL; 95% CI, -2.33 to -0.07 pg/mL), AŒ≤40 (adjusted mean difference, -37.78 pg/mL; 95% CI, -60.16 to -15.39 pg/mL), p-tau181 (adjusted mean difference, -4.66 pg/mL; 95% CI, -7.05 to -1.90 pg/mL), and neurofilament light (adjusted mean difference, -1.58; 95% CI, -2.83 to -0.19 pg/mL) were consistently lower in African American individuals after adjusting for demographic characteristics, educational attainment, cognition, APOE4, and cardiovascular factors. A similar pattern was observed in the CSF biomarkers except for AŒ≤42 and AŒ≤40. Although unadjusted analyses revealed an association between these biomarkers and African ancestry, these associations were not significant after adjusting for the same covariates. Differences by self-reported race were not explained by varied cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein, educational attainment, or Area Deprivation Index. In this cross-sectional study of plasma biomarkers by race and genetic ancestry, the results indicated that plasma p-tau181, AŒ≤40, and NFL were lower in African American individuals based on self-reported race but not genetic ancestry. These differences were not explained by cardiovascular risks or clinical stage differences. These racial differences should be considered in clinical interpretations and clinical trial screenings to avoid an additional increase in underrepresentation of African American individuals in AD trials."

The relationship between blood pressure (BP) control status, visit-to-visit BP variability, and cognitive function remains controversial. We aimed to explore the association between BP control status at baseline, visit-to-visit BP variability, and cognitive function. This study included 3,511 elderlies in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, covering four waves for 7-year follow-up (baseline 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018). BP was measured in Wave 2011, 2013, and 2015. Cognitive function was measured by Mini-Mental State Exam in Wave 2018. Participants were divided into two groups: mid-old group for reflecting midlife BP and cognition (45-59 years at baseline but aged 60 or over in Wave 2018), and old-old group for reflecting late-life BP and cognition (aged 60 or over at baseline). We use univariate analysis and general linear model to analyze. Late-life BP showed stronger associations with cognitive function than midlife BP. As to late-life BP control status, controlled hypertension group get higher cognitive score than uncontrolled hypertension group in language (adjusted Œ≤ = -0.34, 95%CI -0.68 to 0.00), and untreated hypertension group in orientation (adjusted Œ≤ = -0.41, 95%CI -0.72 to -0.11), language (adjusted Œ≤ = -0.35, 95%CI -0.67 to -0.04), and total (adjusted Œ≤ = -0.99, 95%CI -1.85 to -0.12). Regarding visit-to-visit BP variability, midlife visit-to-visit systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability was associated with language (adjusted Œ≤ = -3.70, 95% CI -5.83 to -1.57), while late-life visit-to-visit SBP variability was associated with orientation (adjusted Œ≤ = -2.99, 95% CI -4.84 to -1.14), recall (adjusted Œ≤ = -1.69, 95% CI -2.89 to -0.48), language (adjusted Œ≤ = -2.26, 95% CI -4.13 to -0.38), and total (adjusted Œ≤ = -9.50, 95% CI -14.71 to -4.28); Midlife diastolic blood pressure (DBP) variability and pulse pressure (PP) variability showed a significant relationship with language (adjusted Œ≤ = 3.25, 95% CI -1.31 to -5.19) and calculation (adjusted Œ≤ = -0.26, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.04), respectively. No significant correlation was found between midlife BP control status, late-life visit-to-visit DBP variability, late-life visit-to-visit PP variability, and cognitive score. There was no significant correlation between BP and memory. BP control status and visit-to-visit BP variability were significantly related to cognitive function among the Chinese elderly. Receiving effective late-life antihypertensive treatment and keeping SBP stable might contribute to prevent the development of cognitive impairment and dementia, especially for orientation and language function."

No study has yet assessed the effect of other known CADASIL modifiers, that is, cardiovascular risk factors and sex, in the context of NOTCH3 EGFr group. In this study, we determined the relative disease-modifying effects of NOTCH3 EGFr group, sex and cardiovascular risk factor on disease severity in the first genotype-driven, large prospective CADASIL cohort study, using a comprehensive battery of CADASIL clinical outcomes and neuroimaging markers. Patients with CADASIL participated in a single-center, prospective cohort study (DiViNAS [Disease Variability in NOTCH3 Associated Small Vessel Disease]) between 2017 and 2020. The study protocol included a clinical assessment, neuropsychological test battery and brain magnetic resonance imaging on a single research day. Multivariable linear, logistic and Cox regression models were used to cross-sectionally assess the effect of CADASIL modifiers on clinical severity (stroke, disability, processing speed) and neuroimaging markers (WMH volume, peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity, lacune volume, brain volume, cerebral microbleed count). Two hundred patients with CADASIL participated, of which 103 harbored a NOTCH3 EGFr 1-6 variant and 97 an EGFr 7-34 variant. NOTCH3 EGFr 1-6 group was the most important modifier of age at first stroke (hazard ratio, 2.45 [95% CI, 1.39-4.31]; P=0.002), lacune volume (odds ratio, 4.31 [95% CI, 2.31-8.04]; P=4.0√ó10-6), WMH volume (B=0.81 [95% CI, 0.60-1.02]; P=1.1√ó10-12), and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (B=0.65 [95% CI, 0.44-0.87]; P=1.6√ó10-8). EGFr 1-6 patients had a significantly higher WMH volume in the anterior temporal lobes and superior frontal gyri and a higher burden of enlarged perivascular spaces. After NOTCH3 EGFr group, male sex and hypertension were the next most important modifiers of clinical outcomes and neuroimaging markers. NOTCH3 EGFr group is the most important CADASIL disease modifier not only for age at first stroke and WMH volume but also strikingly so for a whole battery of clinically relevant disease measures such as lacune volume and peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity. NOTCH3 EGFr group is followed in importance by sex, hypertension, diabetes, and smoking."

Alternatively, the associations between hypertension and the risk of Alzheimer's disease are complex and recent large sample studies reported positive associations. In this paper, we examine the associations between diastolic blood pressure (BP) and subsequent changes in brain structure and cognitive function over several years by multiple regression analyses (with adjustment for a wide range of potential confounding variables) among a large cohort from the UK Biobank. Higher baseline diastolic BP was associated with a slightly smaller relative increase (relative improvements) in reaction time and a slightly greater reduction in depression scores. Higher baseline diastolic BP was also associated with a greater total gray matter volume (GMV) retention, while aging alone was associated with GMV reduction. White matter microstructural analyses revealed that a greater diastolic BP was associated with reduced longitudinal mean and regional fractional anisotropy, greater increases in mean and regional mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity, a greater decline in mean intracellular volume fraction, and greater increases in mean and regional isotropic volume fraction. These white matter microstructural changes were consistent with those seen in the aging process. Additional analyses revealed a greater cheese intake level at baseline, which is associated with a subsequent decline in diastolic BP and a relative subsequent increase in depressive tendency together with a relative increase in fluid intelligence and visuospatial memory performance. These results are congruent with the view that a higher BP in the aging brain has a complex role."

The respondents were predominantly women (71%), middle aged (41-60 years; 37%) or above (>60 years; 46%), highly educated (69%) and resided in Europe (98%). Respondents' views were assessed regarding factors that may influence brain health, life periods considered important to look after the brain and diseases and disorders associated with the brain. We run exploratory linear models at a 99% level of significance to assess correlates of the outcome variables, adjusting for likely confounders in a targeted fashion. Of all significant effects, the respondents recognised the impact of lifestyle factors on brain health but had relatively less awareness of the role socioeconomic factors might play. Most respondents rated all life periods as important for the brain (95%-96%), although the prenatal period was ranked significantly lower (84%). Equally, women and highly educated respondents more often rated factors and life periods to be important for brain health. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents associated Alzheimer's disease and dementia with the brain. The respondents made a connection between mental health and the brain, and mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression were significantly more often considered to be associated with the brain than neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. Few respondents (<32%) associated cancer, hypertension, diabetes and arthritis with the brain. Differences in perceptions of brain health were noted among specific segments of the population.

The current study examined whether visit-to-visit blood pressure variability is related to CSF Alzheimer disease biomarker levels over time and whether associations differed by APOE Œµ4 carrier status. In this retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study, cognitively unimpaired or mildly impaired older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative underwent 3 to 4 blood pressure measurements over a 12-month period and ‚â•1 lumbar puncture for evaluation of CSF phosphorylated tau, total tau, and Œ≤-amyloid levels at follow-up (6-108 months later). APOE Œµ4 carriers were defined as having ‚â•1 Œµ4 allele. Visit-to-visit blood pressure variability was determined over 12 months as variability independent of mean. Only CSF samples collected after the final blood pressure measurement were analyzed. Bayesian linear growth modeling investigated the role of blood pressure variability, APOE Œµ4, and the passage of time on CSF biomarker levels after controlling for several variables, including average blood pressure and baseline hypertension. Four hundred sixty-six participants (mean 76.7 [SD 7.1] years of age) were included in the study. Elevated blood pressure variability was associated with increased CSF phosphorylated tau (Œ≤ = 0.81 [95% CI 0.74, 0.97]), increased total tau (Œ≤ = 0.98 [95% CI 0.71, 1.31]), and decreased Œ≤-amyloid levels (Œ≤ = -1.52 [95% CI -3.55, -0.34]) at follow-up. APOE Œµ4 carriers with elevated blood pressure variability had the fastest increase in phosphorylated tau levels (Œ≤ = 9.03 [95% CI 1.67, 16.36]). Blood pressure variability was not significantly related to total tau or Œ≤-amyloid levels over time according to APOE Œµ4 carrier status. Older adults with elevated blood pressure variability exhibit increased CSF phosphorylated tau, increased total tau, and decreased Œ≤-amyloid over time, suggesting that blood pressure variability may correlate with alterations in Alzheimer disease biomarkers. Findings warrant further study of the relationship between blood pressure variability and the development of Alzheimer disease. APOE Œµ4 carrier status moderated relationships between blood pressure variability and CSF phosphorylated tau but not total tau or Œ≤-amyloid, consistent with other studies relating hemodynamic factors to tau changes."

At entry to the study, information about comorbid conditions was systematically collected. Details regarding subsequent diagnoses, seizure activity, changes to treatment, or reports of cognitive impairment were obtained through the family doctor. The variables of interest were compared with UK population data. Mortality in the cohort was 21 of 47 (45%), with an average age at death of 82.5¬†years. Seizures remained well controlled for the majority but medications required adjustments in dose and type for some (28%). A small number (three cases) remained seizure-free without medication. History of cardiovascular disorders was frequent (78.7%), typically involving hypertension (55.3%). Autoimmune disorders (25.5%), cancer (23.4%), and depression (21.3%) were also commonly reported. Although persisting memory problems were often noted, dementia was diagnosed in seven cases (14.9%). Life expectancy and comorbidities in TEA did not differ from available population norms. Results suggest that life expectancy is not reduced in TEA. Although TEA does not appear to be a self-limiting form of epilepsy, seizures are typically well controlled via medication. Because adjustments to medication may be required, even after long periods of stability, ongoing medical monitoring is recommended. Comorbid vascular disorders are frequent but appear similar to general population estimates. Monitoring mood may be important, given that people with chronic conditions are often vulnerable to depression. Because of persisting memory difficulties, the development of effective memory interventions for people with TEA is warranted."

Having a PFH of dementia resulted in a higher LIBRA score (RC=0.15; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.19). We found that having a PFH of dementia was associated with several modifiable risk factors. This suggests that middle-aged individuals with a PFH of dementia are a group at risk and could benefit from DRR. Further research should explore their knowledge, beliefs and attitudes towards DRR, and whether they are willing to assess their risk and change their lifestyle to reduce dementia risk."

However, sex-specific associations between body height and cognitive impairment are not well known in northern rural China. We assessed sex differences in the association between body height and cognitive impairment in a low-income elderly population in rural China. A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2014 to August 2014 to collect basic information from elderly residents aged 60¬†years and older in rural areas of Tianjin, China. Body height and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were measured, and the relationships between these variables were assessed. A total of 1081 residents with a mean age of 67.7¬†years were enrolled in this study. After adjusting for age, educational attainment, smoking status, drinking status, and the presence of hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, higher body height was found to be associated with a decreased prevalence of cognitive impairment in elderly men. Each 1-dm increase in height was associated with a 37% decrease in the prevalence of cognitive impairment. However, there was no significant association between body height and cognitive impairment among elderly women. In conclusion, shorter body height was related to cognitive impairment independently of age, educational attainment, lifestyle factors, and health-related comorbid factors among low-income elderly men in rural China. Accordingly, shorter elderly men may be targeted for effective dementia prevention in rural China."

Aldosterone (ALD) or activation of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) causes cerebrovascular injury in a mouse model. We aimed to analyze the relationship between ALD and WMLs in a population with hypertension. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients screened for causes of secondary hypertension. We enrolled 547 patients with WMLs and matched these to controls without WMLs at a 1:1 ratio. White matter lesion load was assessed by using a modified Scheltens' scale. Among the analytic sample (N = 1,094) with ages ranging from 30 to 64 years, 62.2% were male. We divided plasma ALD concentration (PAC), plasma renin activity (PRA), and ALD-renin ratio (ARR) into the third tertile (Q3), second tertile (Q2), and first tertile (Q1). We also analyzed them simultaneously as continuous variables. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that participants in Q3 (>17.26 ng/dl) of PAC (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.15, 2.19), Q3 (<0.80 ng/dl) of PRA (OR 2.50, 95% CI 1.81, 3.44), and Q3 (>18.59 ng/dl per ng/ml*h) of ARR (OR 2.90, 95% CI 2.10, 4.01) had a significantly higher risk of WMLs than those in Q1 (<12.48) of PAC, Q1 (>2.19) of PRA, and Q1 (<6.96) of ARR. In linear regression analysis, we separately analyzed the correlation between the modified Scheltens' scale score and log(PAC) (Œ≤ = 2.36; 95% CI 1.30, 3.41; p < 0.001), log(PRA) (Œ≤ = -1.76; 95% CI -2.09, -1.43; p < 0.001), and log(ARR) (Œ≤ = 1.86; 95% CI 1.55, 2.17; p < 0.001), which were all significantly correlated with white matter lesion load, after adjusting for confounding factors. Simple mediation analyses showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) mediated -3.83% or -2.66% of the association between PAC and white matter lesion load, respectively. In stratified analyses, there was no evidence of subgroup heterogeneity concerning the change in the risk of WMLs (p > 0.05 for interaction for all). Higher PAC, especially in PAC >17.26 ng/dl, increased the risk of WMLs. PAC was positively associated with white matter lesion load independent of SBP or DBP."

Since most previous studies that examined risk factors for mortality and severity were based on hospitalized individuals, population-based cohort studies are called for to provide evidence that can be extrapolated to the general population. Therefore, we aimed to examine the associations of comorbidities with mortality and disease severity in individuals with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Ontario, Canada. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all individuals with COVID-19 in Ontario, Canada diagnosed between January 15 and December 31, 2020. Cases were linked to health administrative databases maintained in the ICES which covers all residents in Ontario. The primary outcome is all-cause 30-day mortality after the first COVID-19 diagnosis, and the secondary outcome is a composite severity index containing death and hospitalization. To examine the risk factors for the outcomes, we employed Cox proportional hazards regression models and logistic regression models to adjust for demographic, socio-economic variables and comorbidities. Results were also stratified by age groups. A total of 167,500 individuals were diagnosed of COVID-19 in 2020 and included in the study. About half (43.8%, n = 73,378) had at least one comorbidity. The median follow-up period were 30 days. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (24%, n = 40,154), asthma (16%, n = 26,814), and diabetes (14.7%, n = 24,662). Individuals with comorbidity had higher risk of mortality compared to those without (HR = 2.80, 95%CI 2.35-3.34; p<0.001), and the risk substantially was elevated from 2.14 (95%CI 1.76-2.60) to 4.81 (95%CI 3.95-5.85) times as the number of comorbidities increased from one to five or more. Significant predictors for mortality included comorbidities such as solid organ transplant (HR = 3.06, 95%CI 2.03-4.63; p<0.001), dementia (HR = 1.46, 95%CI 1.35-1.58; p<0.001), chronic kidney disease (HR = 1.45, 95%CI 1.34-1.57; p<0.001), severe mental illness (HR = 1.42, 95%CI%, 1.12-1.80; p<0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (HR = 1.22, 95%CI, 1.15-1.30), diabetes (HR = 1.19, 95%, 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR = 1.19, 95%CI 1.12-1.26; p<0.001), cancer (HR = 1.17, 95%CI, 1.09-1.27; p<0.001), hypertension (HR = 1.16, 95%CI, 1.07-1.26; p<0.001). Compared to their effect in older age groups, comorbidities were associated with higher risk of mortality and severity in individuals under 50 years old. Individuals with five or more comorbidities in the below 50 years age group had 395.44 (95%CI, 57.93-2699.44, p<0.001) times higher risk of mortality compared to those without. Limitations include that data were collected during 2020 when the new variants of concern were not predominant, and that the ICES databases do not contain detailed individual-level socioeconomic and racial variables. We found that solid organ transplant, dementia, chronic kidney disease, severe mental illness, CVD, hypertension, COPD, cancer, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, and asthma were associated with mortality or severity. Our study highlights that the number of comorbidities was a strong risk factor for deaths and severe outcomes among younger individuals with COVID-19. Our findings suggest that in addition of prioritizing by age, vaccination priority groups should also include younger population with multiple comorbidities."

The preliminary shift from robust to sarcopenia (i.e., pre-sarcopenia) is an important albeit underdiscussed stage and is the focus of this study. Identifying factors associated with pre-sarcopenia may lead to sarcopenia prevention. To separately examine the effects of dementia and depression on pre-sarcopenia/sarcopenia, we conducted multiple analyses. This cross-sectional study used health checkup data from a rural Japanese island. The participants were aged 60 years and above, and the data included muscle mass, gait speed, handgrip strength, oral status (teeth and denture), chronic diseases (e.g., hypertension), dementia (cognitive assessment for dementia, iPad Version), and depression (self-rating depression scale). A total of 753 older adult participants were divided into the sarcopenia (n = 30), pre-sarcopenia (n = 125), and robust (n = 598) groups. An ordered logit regression analysis indicated that age and depression were positively correlated with sarcopenia, while hypertension was negatively associated with it. A multiple logistic regression analysis between the robust and pre-sarcopenia groups showed significant associations between the same three variables. Depression was associated with pre-sarcopenia, but not dementia. There was also a significant association between hypertension and pre-sarcopenia. Further research is needed to reveal whether the management of these factors can prevent sarcopenia."

We examined the risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline associated with long-term, visit-to-visit BPV in a post hoc analysis of the ASPREE (Aspirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial. Methods and Results ASPREE participants (N=19¬†114) were free of dementia and significant cognitive impairment at enrollment. Measurement of BP and administration of a standardized cognitive battery evaluating global cognition, delayed episodic memory, verbal fluency, and processing speed and attention occurred at baseline and follow-up visits. Time-to-event analysis using Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% CI for incident dementia and cognitive decline, according to tertile of SD of systolic BPV. Individuals in the highest BPV tertile compared with the lowest had an increased risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline, independent of average BP and use of antihypertensive drugs. There was evidence that sex modified the association with incident dementia (interaction P=0.02), with increased risk in men (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.19-2.39) but not women (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.72-1.42). For cognitive decline, similar increased risks were observed for men and women (interaction P=0.15; men: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.16-1.59; women: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.98-1.32).

A traditional meta-analysis with subgroup analysis, and a further dose-response meta-analysis were conducted. Twenty cohort studies with 7¬†924¬†168 persons were included in this review. The results showed that a higher systolic BPV (SBPV), when measured with the coefficient of variation (SBP-CV) or standard deviation (SBP-SD), was associated with a higher risk of all-cause dementia diagnosis but not incidence of cognitive decline on neuropsychological examinations. In subgroup analysis, the effect was more prominent when using BPV of shorter timeframes, during shorter follow-ups, or among the elderly aged more than 65 years. No dose-response relationship could be found. Our study suggested possible positive associations between SBPV and the risk of dementia. Further studies are required to validate these findings."

A total of 211 patients (50 men and 161 women; average age 81.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ6.7‚Äâyears) who had undergone surgery for fragility hip fractures were followed up from immediately after transfer to the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine to 6‚Äâmonths postoperatively. Comorbidities referred to a summary of the following conditions: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver disease, dementia, cerebrovascular accident, and osteoporosis. Functional outcomes included Koval's grade, Functional Ambulatory Category (FAC), Functional Independence Measure (FIM)-locomotion, Modified Rivermead Mobility Index, Berg Balance Scale (BBS), 4-Meter Walking speed Test (4MWT), the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination(K-MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), EuroQol Five-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire, the Korean version of the Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI), the Korean version of the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (K-IADL), and Korean version of Fatigue, Resistance, Ambulation, Illnesses, and Loss of weight scale (K-FRAIL). For all tests, each patient was assessed immediately after transfer and 6‚Äâmonths post-surgery. Multivariate linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, the initial variable of the functional outcomes, and comorbidities revealed that dementia had a significant negative impact on Koval's grade and K-FRAIL 6‚Äâmonths postoperatively.

This study investigated the relationship between body mass index (BMI), body composition, and cognitive function in a community-dwelling elderly Korean population.This cohort-based cross-sectional analysis included 2386 elderly participants aged between 70 and 84‚Ääyears from the Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study for 2016 to 2017. To investigate the relationship between body composition and cognitive function in community-dwelling individuals, BMI and body composition, including total and trunk fat mass and fat-free mass, were measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fat mass index (FMI), trunk fat mass index (TFMI), and fat-free mass index (FFMI) were used to represent the body composition. A short form of the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer disease was used to assess cognitive function. To evaluate the relationship between variables, simple and fully adjusted multivariable analyses were performed using generalized linear regression models.The mean ages were 76.8‚Ääyears for males and 76.1‚Ääyears for females. The BMI of male participants was significantly lower than that of females (23.9‚Ää¬±‚Ää2.89 vs 24.7‚Ää¬±‚Ää3.02‚Ääkg/m2, P‚Ää<‚Ää.001).

The statistically significant (P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05) adverse factors that contribute in developing dementia were age (aHR 1.07, 1.05-1.09), Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) (aHR 1.17, 1.12-1.23), diagnosis with cerebrovascular disease (aHR 3.73, 1.81-7.66), living with diabetes (aHR 2.30, 1.22-4.35), and living with high blood pressure (HBP) (aHR 2.05, 1.09-3.87). In contrast, the statistically significant protective factors against developing dementia were current alcohol consumption (aHR 0.67, 0.46-0.99), higher educational attainment (aHR 0.36, 0.26-0.56), and regular exercise (aHR 0.37, 0.26-0.51). The factors with a statistically significant adverse association with progression to MCI were age (aHR 1.02, 1.01-1.03) and CESD-10 (aHR 1.17, 1.14-1.19). In contrast, the statistically significant protective factors against developing MCI were BMI (aHR 0.96, 0.94-0.98), higher educational attainment (aHR 0.33, 0.26-0.43), and regular exercise (aHR 0.83, 0.74-0.92). In lieu of the protective factor of MCI and dementia, implementing regular exercise routine well before mid-life and cognitive decline is significant, with adjustments made for those suffering from health conditions, so they can continue exercising despite their morbidity.

The Cox regression hazard model for the patients with available clinical information (core cohort) (n = 2,254) showed the risk factors for 28-day mortality: age > 70 (hazard ratio [HR], 4.219, P = 0.002), need for O‚ÇÇ supply at admission (HR, 2.995; P = 0.001), fever (> 37.5¬∞C) (HR, 2.808; P = 0.001), diabetes (HR, 2.119; P = 0.008), cancer (HR, 3.043; P = 0.011), dementia (HR, 5.252; P = 0.008), neurological disease (HR, 2.084; P = 0.039), heart failure (HR, 3.234; P = 0.012), and hypertension (HR, 2.160; P = 0.017). The median duration for release from isolation was 33 days (interquartile range, 24.0-46.0) in survivors. The Cox proportional hazard model for the long duration of isolation included severity, age > 70, and dementia. Overall, asymptomatic to mild patients were approximately 77% of the total cohort (asymptomatic, 30.6%). The case fatality rate was 2.5%. Risk factors, including older age, need for O‚ÇÇ supply, dementia, and neurological disorder at admission, could help clinicians to identify COVID-19 patients with poor prognosis at an early stage."

This study investigated the association between MetS and cognitive functioning in middle-aged Bulgarians across different definitions of MetS severity. Our cross-sectional sample included 112 participants (67 free of MetS and 45 with MetS) with a mean age of 50.04¬†¬±¬†3.31¬†years. The following MetS variables were considered-presence of MetS, continuously measured MetS components, dichotomized MetS components, number of MetS components present, and Metabolic Syndrome Severity Score (MSSS). Participants' cognitive performance was assessed using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Neuropsychological Battery (CERAD-NB). We employed multivariate regression models to investigate the associations between different measures of MetS severity and CERAD-NB total and subtest scores. Bivariate analyses showed that the CERAD-NB total score was significantly higher in women, participants with a university degree, those with normal blood pressure, normal waist circumference, and low triglyceride levels, compared with their counterparts. MetS participants had lower CERAD-NB total score (78.87¬†¬±¬†6.89 vs. 84.97¬†¬±¬†7.84) and specifically performed poorer on the subtest Word List Recall (7.16¬†¬±¬†1.52 vs. 7.99¬†¬±¬†1.52). These findings persisted after controlling for age, gender, and education. Next, generalized linear regression indicated that the CERAD-NB total score was lower in participants with MetS (Œ≤¬†=¬†-4.86; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.60, -2.11), those with more MetS components (Œ≤¬†=¬†-8.31; 95% CI: -14.13, -2.50 for fours vs. 0 components) and with an increase in MSSS (Œ≤¬†=¬†-3.19; 95% CI: -4.67, -1.71). Hypertension independently contributed to lower CERAD-NB total score (Œ≤¬†=¬†-4.00; 95% CI: -6.81, -1.19). Across several definitions, MetS was associated with lower cognitive functioning, and MetS severity appeared to be a better predictor than most MetS components. Recognizing and reducing severity of MetS components might be helpful in supporting cognitive functioning. Further longitudinal research is needed to shed more light on the relationship between MetS and cognitive functioning across the life span."

In this cross-sectional study, 24 AD participants, 37 MCI participants, and 29 controls were diagnosed according to internationally accepted criteria. OCTA images of the superficial and deep capillary plexus (SCP, DCP) of the retinal microvasculature were obtained using a commercial OCTA system (Zeiss Cirrus HD-5000 with AngioPlex, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). The main outcome measures were vessel density (VD) and fractal dimension (FD) in the SCP and DCP within a 2.5-mm ring around the fovea which were compared between groups. Perfusion density of large vessels and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area were additional outcome parameters. Age, gender, and race did not differ among groups. However, there was a significant difference in diabetes status (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.039) and systolic blood pressure (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.008) among the groups. After adjusting for confounders, AD participants showed significantly decreased VD in SCP and DCP (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006 and P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.015, respectively) and decreased FD in SCP (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006), compared to controls. MCI participants showed significantly decreased VD and FD only in SCP (P‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.006 and P‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, respectively) and not the DCP (P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05) compared with controls. There was no difference in the OCTA variables between AD and MCI (P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). Perfusion density of large vessels and FAZ area did not differ significantly between groups (P‚Äâ>‚Äâ0.05). Eyes of patients with AD have significantly reduced macular VD in both plexuses whereas MCI participants only showed reduction in the superficial plexus.

The identification of risk factors on progression to the severity stages is essential in providing more efficient and suitable management to COVID-19 patients. However, there is insufficient study on risk factors for severity stages of COVID-19 patients. In this study, 2959 confirmed COVID-19 patients were analyzed while using national data, COVID-19 patients Clinical Epidemiological Information provided from the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency. The epidemiological variable, hospital room, periods from confirmation to release, initial symptom and vital signs, underlying comorbidities, and initial blood variables were used to verify the relation with progression to severity stages of COVID-19 and severe COVID-19. The chi-square test, welch test, multiple regression and logistic regression analysis were performed. The ICU (Intensive Care Unit) admission rate of patients having characteristics, such as older age, male, abnormal BMI (Body Mass Index), high heart rate, high body temperature, fever, cough, sputum, sore throat, rhinorrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, change of consciousness, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic artery disease, chronic kidney disease, cancer, dementia, abnormal hemoglobin, abnormal hematocrit, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, and abnormal white blood cell were high. The risk factors for severe COVID-19 were older age, shorter hospitalization, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, dyspnea, change of consciousness, and dementia. Whereas, significant predictors for progression to severity stages of COVID-19 were older age, longer period from confirmation to release, higher BMI, higher body temperature, abnormal lymphocyte, abnormal platelets, fever, no sore throat, dyspnea, no headache, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), and dementia. Therefore, classifying patients with a high risk of severe stage of COVID-19 and managing patients by considering the risk factors could be helpful in the efficient management of COVID-19 patients."

We used a large nationally representative database of people registered with general practitioners in England (QResearch). Between 2013 and 2017, we analysed attendance at NHS Health Checks and outcomes in the succeeding 12 months, in people with serious mental illness (SMI) including psychoses and in people prescribed long-term antidepressant medications (LTAD), with comparison to attendees who did not have these conditions. Hazard ratios (HR) were used to describe the association between outcomes and SMI and LTAD adjusting for sociodemographic variables. In those eligible for the NHS Health Check programme, we found a higher percentage of people with SMI attended an NHS Health Check (65 490, 19.8%) than those without SMI (524 728, 16.6%); adjusted HR 1.05 [95% confidence interval 1.02-1.08]. We also observed a higher percentage of attendance in people on LTAD (46 437, 20.1%) compared to people who were not prescribed LTAD (543 781, 16.7%); adjusted HR 1.10 (1.08-1.13).

People on LTAD were more likely to be identified with CKD (HR 1.55, 1.42-1.70) and type 2 diabetes (HR 1.45, 1.31-1.60) and also hypertension, cardiovascular disease, non-diabetic hyperglycaemia, familial hypercholesterolemia and dementia within the 12 months following their NHS Health Check. Statins were more likely to be prescribed to NHS Health Check attendees with SMI and those on LTAD than those without these conditions; HR 1.31 (1.25-1.38) and 1.91 (1.82-2.01), respectively. Antihypertensives were more likely to be prescribed to those on LTAD; HR 1.21 (1.14-1.29). We found evidence that people with SMI or on LTAD treatment were 5-10% more likely to access NHS Health Checks than people without these conditions. People with SMI or on LTAD treatment who attended NHS Health Checks had higher rates of diagnosis of CKD, type 2 diabetes and some other relevant co-morbidities and increased treatment with statins and also anti-hypertensive medication in people on LTAD.

Levels for each of these variables were defined within six 2-year time intervals over the 12 years prior to the index date. Case-control differences in exposures of interest were modelled for each time period and adjusted for demographic and clinical factors (ischaemic/unspecified stroke, type 2 diabetes mellitus, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension diagnosis, antihypertensive medication, cholesterol-lowering medication). Coefficients and interactions with time period were meta-analysed across the six databases.

Time variations in coefficients for cholesterol levels were less consistent between databases and those for DBP were largely not significant. Routine clinical data show emerging divergence in levels of BMI and SBP prior to the diagnosis of dementia but less evidence for DBP or total cholesterol levels. These divergences should receive at least some consideration in routine dementia risk screening, although underlying mechanisms still require further investigation."

Home blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed for one week, twice a day, according to international guidelines. BPV was defined as the within-subject coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean BP*100). We used multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, diabetes, antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease, and mean BP. For 82 patients (aged 71.2¬±7.9 years), mean home BP was 140/79¬±15/9‚ÄämmHg. Dementia and mild cognitive impairment were diagnosed in 46% and 34%, respectively. 78% had one or more markers of cSVD.

Univariate and binary logistic regression analysis were adjusted for the following variables: to determine prognosis; Child-Pugh scores, lymphocyte count, platelet count, hemoglobin level, albumin level and pre-PPG or PPA. The outcome showed that PPA was better than pre-PPG and albumin for predicting ascites according to area under receiver operating characteristic curves and a statistical model that also showed PPA's influence 6-months post-TIPS.

In a prospective cohort study ongoing since 1989 in the Netherlands, 5,273 dementia-free participants (58.1% women; mean [SD] age, 67.6 [8.0] years) were included. As of 2016, 1,059 dementia cases occurred during a median follow-up of 14.6 years. Absolute variation in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was assessed as the absolute difference in SBP divided by the mean over two sequential visits every 4.2 (median) years, with the first quantile set as the reference level. The direction was the rise or fall in SBP, with the third quantile set as the reference level. We estimated the risk of dementia in relation to SBP variation measured at different time windows (i.e., at least 0, 5, 10, and 15 years) prior to dementia diagnosis, with adjustments for age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, vascular risk factors, and history of cardiovascular disease. We repeated the above analysis for variation in diastolic blood pressure (DBP). A large SBP variation was associated with an increased dementia risk, which became more pronounced with longer intervals between the assessment of SBP variation and the diagnosis of dementia. The hazard ratio (HR) associated with large variation (the highest quintile) increased from 1.08 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-1.34, P = 0.337) for risk within 5 years of SBP variation measurement to 3.13 (95% CI 2.05-4.77; P < 0.001) for risk after at least 15 years since the measurement of SBP variation. The increased long-term risk was associated with both large rises (HR for the highest quintile, 3.31 [95% CI 2.11-5.18], P < 0.001) and large falls in SBP (HR for the lowest quintile, 2.20 [95% CI 1.33-3.63], P = 0.002), whereas the higher short-term risk was only associated with large falls in SBP (HR, 1.21 [95% CI 1.00-1.48], P = 0.017). Similar findings were observed for variation in DBP. Despite our assessment of major confounders, potential residual confounding is possible, and the findings on blood pressure variability over periods of years may not be generalizable to variability over periods of days and other shorter periods. Results of this study showed that a large blood pressure variation over a period of years was associated with an increased long-term risk of dementia. The association between blood pressure variation and dementia appears most pronounced when this variation occurred long before the diagnosis. An elevated long-term risk of dementia was observed with both a large rise and fall in blood pressure."

We investigated associations between blood pressure and blood pressure changes at and between 36, 43, 53, 60-64, and 69 years of age with WMHV using generalised linear models with a gamma distribution and log link function, amyloid-Œ≤ status using logistic regression, whole-brain volume and hippocampal volumes using linear regression, and PACC score using linear regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Between May 28, 2015, and Jan 10, 2018, 502 individuals were assessed as part of Insight 46. 465 participants (238 [51%] men; mean age 70¬∑7 years [SD 0¬∑7]; 83 [18%] amyloid-Œ≤-positive) were included in imaging analyses. Higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at age 53 years and greater increases in SBP and DBP between 43 and 53 years were positively associated with WMHV at 69-71 years of age (increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater SBP 7%, 95% CI 1-14, p=0¬∑024; increase in mean WMHV per 10 mm Hg greater DBP 15%, 4-27, p=0¬∑0057; increase in mean WMHV per one SD change in SBP 15%, 3-29, p=0¬∑012; increase in mean WMHV per 1 SD change in DBP 15%, 3-30, p=0¬∑017). Higher DBP at 43 years of age was associated with smaller whole-brain volume at 69-71 years of age (-6¬∑9 mL per 10 mm Hg greater DBP, -11¬∑9 to -1¬∑9, p=0¬∑0068), as were greater increases in DBP between 36 and 43 years of age (-6¬∑5 mL per 1 SD change, -11¬∑1 to -1¬∑9, p=0¬∑0054). Greater increases in SBP between 36 and 43 years of age were associated with smaller hippocampal volumes at 69-71 years of age (-0¬∑03 mL per 1 SD change, -0¬∑06 to -0¬∑001, p=0¬∑043). Neither absolute blood pressure nor change in blood pressure predicted amyloid-Œ≤ status or PACC score at 69-71 years of age. High and increasing blood pressure from early adulthood into midlife seems to be associated with increased WMHV and smaller brain volumes at 69-71 years of age. We found no evidence that blood pressure affected cognition or cerebral amyloid-Œ≤ load at this age. Blood pressure monitoring and interventions might need to start around 40 years of age to maximise late-life brain health.

A cross-sectional study with an analytical approach was employed. Clinical data were collected from the elderly from August 2015 to February 2016. The dependent variable was the risk of heart failure; the independent variable was vitamin D deficiency; and intervening factors were age, gender, education, ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, renal failure, dementia, stroke, dyslipidaemia, depression, smoking, alcoholism, obesity, andropause, and cardiac arrhythmia. To analyse the association between vitamin D deficiency and risk of heart failure, we used the bivariate logistic analysis, followed by analysis through the multivariate logistic regression model. Of the 137 elderly, the study found the following: women (75.9%); overweight (48.2%); obese (30.6%); increase in the index waist/hip (88.3%); dyslipidaemia (94.2%) and hypertension (91.2%); coronary artery disease (35.0%); and 27.7% with cardiac arrhythmia or left ventricular hypertrophy. Sixty-five per cent of the elderly were deficient in vitamin D. The risk of heart failure was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency [odds ratio (OR): 12.19; 95% confidence interval (CI)¬†=¬†4.23-35.16; P¬†=¬†0.000], male gender (OR: 15.32; 95% CI¬†=¬†3.39-69.20, P¬†=¬†0.000), obesity (OR: 4.17; 95% CI¬†=¬†1.36-12.81; P¬†=¬†0.012), and cardiac arrhythmia (OR: 3.69; 95% CI¬†=¬†1.23-11.11; P¬†=¬†0.020). There was a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in the elderly, and the evidence shows a strong association between vitamin D deficiency and increased risk of heart failure in this population."

We aimed to investigate the composite effect of the visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, and body mass index on the risk of dementia. A population-based cohort study including 2,930,816 subjects without a history of dementia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia who underwent ‚â•‚Äâ3 health examinations was performed. The coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation, and variability independent of the mean were calculated as variability indices. High variability was defined as having values in the highest quartile for each parameter. A total of 32,901 (1.12%) participants developed dementia, of which 74.4% and 11.0% were attributable to Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, respectively, during the median follow-up of 5.5¬†years. Individuals with higher variability of each parameter were at higher risk of future dementia. In the multivariable adjusted model, the hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of all-cause dementia were 1.22 (1.19-1.26) for one parameter, 1.39 (1.35-1.43) for two parameters, 1.54 (1.48-1.60) for three parameters, and 1.73 (1.60-1.88) for four parameters compared with subjects having no parameters of high variability measured as the CV. Consistent results were noted for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, using other indices of variability and in various sensitivity and subgroup analyses. There was a linear association between the number of high variability parameters and risk of dementia. Reducing variability of metabolic parameters would be a target to preserve cognitive reserve in the general population."

Only a minority of participants included in these studies were aged over 80. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the association between physical fitness and dementia in the oldest old. Subjects (n¬†=‚Äâ488) were enrolled in the Lothian Birth Cohort 1921 and aged 79 at baseline. Dementia cases arising after enrolment were determined using data from death certificates, electronic patient records and clinical reviews. Fitness measures included grip strength, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and walking speed over 6¬†m, measured at 79¬†years. Dementia risk associated with each fitness variable was initially determined by logistic regression analysis, followed by Cox regression analysis, where death was considered as a competing risk. APOE Œµ4 status, age, sex, height, childhood IQ, smoking, history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, hypertension and diabetes were included as additional variables. Cumulative incidence graphs were calculated using Aalen-Johansen Estimator. Although initial results indicated that greater FEV1 was associated with an increased risk of dementia (OR (odds ratio per unit increase) 1.93, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.03, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416), taking into account the competing risk of mortality, none of the fitness measures were found to be associated with dementia; FEV1 (HR (hazard ratio per unit increase) 1.30, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.37, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416), grip strength (HR 0.98, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.35, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416), walking speed (HR 0.99, p‚Äâ=‚Äâ0.90, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416). The presence of an APOE …õ4 allele was however an important predictor for dementia (HR 2.85, p‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.001, n‚Äâ=‚Äâ416). Cumulative incidence graphs supported these findings, with an increased risk of dementia for APOE …õ4 carriers compared with non-carriers. While increased FEV1 was associated with reduced risk of death, there was no reduction in risk for dementia. In contrast to previous studies, this study found that lower fitness beyond age 79 was not a risk factor for subsequent dementia. This finding is not explained by those with poorer physical fitness, who would have been more likely to develop dementia, having died before onset of dementia symptoms."

Results of a 15,105 brazilian adult baseline cohort.","The aging of the population may lead to an increased prevalence of dementia and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and their overlap. We investigated the association between CKD and cognitive performance among Brazilian adults (35-74 years). Baseline data analysis of the Longitudinal Study of Adults (ELSA-Brasil), a multicenter cohort comprising 15,105 civil servants, was performed. Kidney function was defined by the CKD-Epi-estimated GRF and albumin creatinin ratio (ACR). Cognitive performance was measured across tests that included the word memory tests, verbal fluency tests and Trail Making Test B. Multiple logistic and linear regressions were used to investigate the association between CKD and global as well as test-specific lowered cognitive performance. More than 90% of participants did not present CKD even considering reduced GFR or increased ACR simultaneously. Lowered cognitive performance was detected among 15.8% of the participants and mean values of GFR were slightly higher among those with normal than with lowered cognitive performance (86 ¬± 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 x 85 ¬± 16 mL/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.01). Age, education, skin-color, smoking, drinking, hypertension, and diabetes were associated with lowered cognition. After adjustment for these variables, there was no association between CKD and lowered cognitive performance. Negligibly small beta values were observed when analyzing CKD and the scores of all tests. These results suggest that cognitive performance remains preserved until renal function reaches significant worsening. Preventive measures to maintain renal function may contribute to the preservation of cognitive function."

Only two-thirds of dementia cases are currently recorded in primary care, so increasing the proportion of cases diagnosed is a strategic priority for the UK and internationally. Variables in the primary care record may indicate risk of developing dementia, and could be combined in a predictive model to help find patients who are missing a diagnosis. We conducted a meta-analysis to identify clinical entities with potential for use in such a predictive model for dementia in primary care. We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Web of Science and primary care database bibliographies. We included cohort or case-control studies which used routinely collected primary care data, to measure the association between any clinical entity and dementia. Meta-analyses were performed to pool odds ratios. A sensitivity analysis assessed the impact of non-independence of cases between studies. From a sift of 3836 papers, 20 studies, all European, were eligible for inclusion, comprising >1 million patients. 75 clinical entities were assessed as risk factors for all cause dementia, Alzheimer's (AD) and Vascular dementia (VaD). Data included were unexpectedly heterogeneous, and assumptions were made about definitions of clinical entities and timing as these were not all well described. Meta-analysis showed that neuropsychiatric symptoms including depression, anxiety, and seizures, cognitive symptoms, and history of stroke, were positively associated with dementia. Cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, heart disease, dyslipidaemia and diabetes were positively associated with VaD and negatively with AD. Sensitivity analyses showed similar results. These findings are of potential value in guiding feature selection for a risk prediction tool for dementia in primary care. Limitations include findings being UK-focussed. Further predictive entities ascertainable from primary care data, such as changes in consulting patterns, were absent from the literature and should also be explored in future studies."

Cross-sectional, observational. Broader New York City area. Two research centres affiliated with the Alzheimer's disease Core Center at New York University School of Medicine. We studied 116 cognitively normal healthy research participants aged 30-60 years, who completed a three-dimensional T1-weighted volumetric MRI and had lifestyle (diet, physical activity and intellectual enrichment), vascular risk (overweight, hypertension, insulin resistance, elevated cholesterol and homocysteine) and cognition (memory, executive function, language) data. Estimates of cortical thickness for entorhinal (EC), posterior cingulate, orbitofrontal, inferior and middle temporal cortex were obtained by use of automated segmentation tools. We applied confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling to evaluate the associations between lifestyle, vascular risk, brain and cognition. Adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet (MeDi) and insulin sensitivity were both positively associated with MRI-based cortical thickness (diet: Œ≤s‚â•0.26, insulin sensitivity Œ≤s‚â•0.58, P‚â§0.008). After accounting for vascular risk, EC in turn explained variance in memory (P‚â§0.001). None of the other lifestyle and vascular risk variables were associated with brain thickness. In addition, the path associations between intellectual enrichment and better cognition were significant (Œ≤s‚â•0.25 P‚â§0.001), as were those between overweight and lower cognition (Œ≤s‚â•-0.22, P‚â§0.01). In cognitively normal middle-aged adults, MeDi and insulin sensitivity explained cortical thickness in key brain regions for AD, and EC thickness predicted memory performance in turn. Intellectual activity and overweight were associated with cognitive performance through different pathways. Our findings support further investigation of lifestyle and vascular risk factor modification against brain ageing and AD. More studies with larger samples are needed to replicate these research findings in more diverse, community-based settings."

Prospective cohort. 1236 community-dwelling patients from an inner-city public health care system, aged 65¬†years and older, with a history of hypertension but no history of dementia, and who had at least three primary care visits and a prescription filled for any medication. Blood pressure was the average of three seated measurements. Dementia was diagnosed using a two-stage design, with a screening evaluation every 2 to 3 years followed by a comprehensive in-home clinical evaluation for those with a positive screen. Laboratory, inpatient and outpatient encounter data, coded diagnoses and procedures, and medication records were derived from a health information exchange. Of the 1236 hypertensive participants without dementia at baseline, 114 (9%) developed incident dementia during follow-up.

This study aimed to determine whether such DTI and PET variations are also interrelated in a high-risk population of older hypertensive patients with only subjective memory complaints (SMC). Sixty older hypertensive patients (75¬†¬±¬†5¬†years) with SMC were referred to DTI and FDG-PET brain imaging, executive and memory tests, as well as peripheral and central blood pressure (BP) measurements. Mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmean) was determined in overall white matter and correlated with the grey matter distribution of the metabolic rate of glucose (CMRGlc) using whole-brain voxel-based analyses of FDG-PET images. ADCmean was variable between individuals, ranging from 0.82 to 1.01.10-¬†3¬†mm2¬†sec-¬†1, and mainly in relation with CMRGlc of areas involved in Alzheimer's disease such as internal temporal areas, posterior associative junctions, posterior cingulum but also insulo-opercular areas (global correlation coefficient: -¬†0.577, p¬†<¬†0.001). Both the ADCmean and CMRGlc of the interrelated grey matter areas were additionally and concordantly linked to the results of executive and memory tests and to systolic central BP (all p¬†<¬†0.05). Altogether, our findings show that cross-sectional variations in overall white brain matter are linked to the metabolism of Alzheimer-like cortical areas and to cognitive performance in older hypertensive patients with only subjective memory complaints. Additional relationships with central BP strengthen the hypothesis of a contributing pathogenic role of hypertension."

Ongoing clinical trials aim to evaluate the effectiveness of approved antihypertensives in preventing dementia, including patients with and without hypertension. In order for a dementia prevention strategy using antihypertensives to be effective, it is critical to understand patient concerns about this strategy in both users and non-users of antihypertensives. Thus, this study examined the association between current use of antihypertensive and having concerns about using an antihypertensive as a dementia prevention strategy, as well as sociodemographic factors associated with concerns. Cross-sectional, ¬†self-administered, web-based survey was conducted among 1661 patients in a large health system in January 2018. Participants reported whether they were currently taking an antihypertensive (yes/no), and what types of hypothetical concerns they have about the idea of taking an antihypertensive to prevent dementia (yes/no, for each of 7 concerns). Associations between the two variables were assessed via logistic regression, and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Most respondents were female (77%), 51-70 years of age (64%), and white (89%), with 30% reporting current antihypertensive use. Compared to current users, non-users were more likely to report the five following concerns: side effects from the medication, hassle to take medications, lack of evidence, not wanting to use medications, and already having normal/low blood pressure. Non-users were also less likely to report having no concerns (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.2-0.4) compared to current users. Younger age and lower income were associated with having more concerns. Patients not currently using an antihypertensive are more likely to have concerns about using an antihypertensive for dementia prevention, compared to current antihypertensive users. Patient perspectives are important to consider for the implementation of dementia prevention strategies."

Background: Given the barriers prohibiting the broader utilization of amyloid imaging and high screening failure rate in clinical trials, an easily available and valid screening method for identifying cognitively impaired patients with cerebral amyloid deposition is needed. Therefore, we developed a prediction model for cerebral amyloid positivity in cognitively impaired patients using variables that are routinely obtained in memory clinics
Methods: Six hundred and fifty two cognitively impaired subjects from the Korean Brain Aging Study for the Early diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer disease (KBASE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-2 (ADNI-2) cohorts were included in this study (107 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 69 Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia patients for KBASE cohort, and 332 MCI and 144 AD dementia patients for ADNI-2 cohort). Using the cross-sectional dataset from the KBASE cohort, a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was conducted to develop a cerebral amyloid prediction model using variables commonly obtained in memory clinics. For each participant, the logit value derived from the final model was calculated, and the probability for being amyloid positive, which was calculated from the logit value, was named the amyloid prediction index. The final model was validated using an independent dataset from the ADNI-2 cohort
Results: The final model included age, sex, years of education, history of hypertension, apolipoprotein Œµ4 positivity, and score from a word list recall test. The model predicted that younger age, female sex, higher educational level, absence of hypertension history, presence of apolipoprotein Œµ4 allele, and lower score of word list recall test are associated with higher probability for being amyloid positive. The amyloid prediction index derived from the model was proven to be valid across the two cohorts. The area under the curve was 0.873 (95% confidence interval 0.815 to 0.918) for the KBASE cohort, and 0.808 (95% confidence interval = 0.769 to 0.842) for ADNI-2 cohort
Conclusion: The amyloid prediction index, which was based on commonly available clinical information, can be useful for screening cognitively impaired individuals with a high probability of amyloid deposition in therapeutic trials for early Alzheimer's disease as well as in clinical practice."
